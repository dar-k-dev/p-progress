- [ ] Enable Authentication
- [ ] Enable Firestore Database
- [ ] Enable Cloud Messaging
- [ ] Add web app to Firebase project
- [ ] Download and configure service account key

### 3. Push Notifications Setup
- [ ] Generate VAPID key pair
- [ ] Configure Firebase Cloud Messaging
- [ ] Test push notification delivery
- [ ] Set up notification templates

### 4. CDN Configuration
- [ ] Set up CDN for static assets
- [ ] Configure update package distribution
- [ ] Set up proper CORS headers
- [ ] Test download speeds from different regions

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Build and Test
```bash
npm run build
npm run test-update
npm run demo-update
```

### 2. Deploy to Production
```bash
# Deploy to your hosting platform
npm run deploy

# Or manual deployment
npm run build
# Upload dist/ folder to your server
```

### 3. Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Test app loading and functionality
- [ ] Verify push notifications work
- [ ] Test update system end-to-end
- [ ] Check analytics and monitoring
- [ ] Verify PWA installation works

## Update Publishing Workflow

### For Bug Fixes (Patch)
```bash
npm run version:patch
```

### For New Features (Minor)
```bash
npm run version:minor
```

### For Breaking Changes (Major)
```bash
npm run version:major
```

### Manual Update Publishing
```bash
npm run build
npm run publish-update
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Daily Checks
- [ ] Monitor update delivery success rates
- [ ] Check push notification delivery
- [ ] Review error logs and user feedback
- [ ] Monitor app performance metrics

### Weekly Tasks
- [ ] Review update adoption rates
- [ ] Analyze user engagement metrics
- [ ] Check for security updates
- [ ] Update dependencies if needed

### Monthly Tasks
- [ ] Review and update documentation
- [ ] Analyze user feedback and feature requests
- [ ] Plan next release cycle
- [ ] Security audit and penetration testing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Push notifications not working**
   - Check VAPID keys configuration
   - Verify Firebase setup
   - Ensure HTTPS in production

2. **Updates not downloading**
   - Check CDN configuration
   - Verify CORS headers
   - Test network connectivity

3. **Installation failures**
   - Check service worker registration
   - Verify update package integrity
   - Check browser compatibility

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Enable debug logging
localStorage.setItem('debug-updates', 'true');

# Test update system
npm run test-update

# Create demo update
npm run demo-update
```

## Security Considerations

- [ ] All communications use HTTPS
- [ ] Update packages are signed and verified
- [ ] User data is encrypted at rest and in transit
- [ ] Regular security audits are performed
- [ ] Dependency vulnerabilities are monitored

## Performance Optimization

- [ ] Enable gzip/brotli compression
- [ ] Configure proper caching headers
- [ ] Optimize images and assets
- [ ] Use CDN for global distribution
- [ ] Monitor Core Web Vitals

## Backup and Recovery

- [ ] Regular database backups
- [ ] Version control for all code changes
- [ ] Rollback plan for failed deployments
- [ ] Disaster recovery procedures documented
