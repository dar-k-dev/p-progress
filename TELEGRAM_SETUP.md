# 🤖 Telegram Bot Setup for Support Messages

## ✅ **Setup Complete!**

I've integrated your Telegram bot using the username approach.

### **Bot Configuration:**
- **Bot Token:** `8366110415:AAGqQ0qoae1fHF7-lCSt6e1isjoOFrqG3ys`
- **Bot Username:** `@retrieval1bot`

## 📝 **How It Works:**

The contact form now sends messages directly to `@retrieval1bot` using the Telegram HTTP API with the bot username.

## 📱 **Message Format**

When users submit the contact form, you'll receive a formatted message like this:

```
🆘 New Support Request - ProgressPulse

👤 Name: John Doe
📧 Email: john@example.com
📂 Category: Technical Problem
📝 Subject: App not loading

💬 Message:
The app keeps crashing when I try to add a new goal. 
I've tried refreshing but it doesn't help.
